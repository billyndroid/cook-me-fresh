        <h2>About Us</h2>
       <p>Cook Me Fresh was created to bring real, practical cooking support into people’s homes. Founded by Gavin Akers—a chef with over 20 years of experience—our mission is to help you feel confident cooking fresh, healthy meals, whether you’re shopping on a budget or using the very best ingredients available.</p>
    <p>Gav’s journey in food includes co-running a restaurant in British Columbia, Canada, co-owning
the popular Flagstones Tapas Bar, running his own bakery, and gaining hands-on experience in
butchery. He’s also delivered public food demonstrations for Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) Council
in Ynysangharad War Memorial Park, sharing his love of cooking with the wider community.</p>
<p>Whether it’s one-to-one support or small group demonstrations, everything is tailored to your
kitchen, your lifestyle, and what you actually want to eat.</p>
<p>Based in South Wales, Cook Me Fresh focuses on local, seasonal ingredients and smart
shopping advice—so you can cook well without the stress.</p>

<p>At the heart of it all, it’s not about being perfect. It’s about feeling good, eating well, and
enjoying the process. </p>
